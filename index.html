      <h1>Detecting the Ball</h1>
      <p>Naturally, a core element of robot soccer is ball detection. On this page we provide you with a sandbox to build a simple ball detection algorithm on your own! There is an exemplary image out of our simulated environment picturing the opponents goal, some field lines, as well as an orange ball. Please write a program in Python that detects the ball in x- and y-coordinates.</p>
      <p>Basic knowledge of <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers">Python</a> is required.</p>
      <p>We provide the following classes and functions to assist you in accomplishing this task:</p>
      <h2>Image</h2>
      <p>The Image object contains RGB color information for each pixel which can be accessed by calling the <code>at()</code> method with x- and y-coordinates.</p>
      <p>For example, the red value of pixel with coordinates <code>x=0</code> and <code>y=10</code> can be accessed using: <code>image.at(x=0, x=10).r</code></p>
      <p>The size of the image is returned by <code>image.width</code> and <code>image.height</code>.</p>
      <h2>get_ball_image()</h2>
      <p><code>get_ball_image()</code> returns a reference to the <code>Image</code> object you're going to work with.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>image = get_ball_image()</code></p>
      <h2>plot_detected_ball()</h2>
      <p><code>plot_detected_ball()</code> takes x- and y-coordinates, and a radius and places a yellow circle on the image. You are free to call it multiple times with differing values to create multiple circles.</p>
      <p>Example: <code>plot_detected_ball(x=42, y=1337, radius=17)</code></p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>The goal of this task is to plot a perfect circle around the ball.</p>
      <p>Look at the example code, click on "Run program", then look at the image.</p>
      <p id="ball_detection">Loading interactive ball detection widget...</p>
      <h2>Too easy?</h2>
      <p>Beside the "Red ball" image, we have prepared more images for you. You can select a different image above and test your algorithm again.</p>
      <p>The "Red ball" image is an idealized example from our simulator using a red ball. In reality, we are playing on a real field with natural lighting conditions and with a black-and-white soccer ball.</p>
